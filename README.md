# README File Generator

## Welcome to the Future of Documentation!

Are you tired of wrestling with README files? Do you find yourself lost in a sea of markdown syntax, struggling to make your project shine? Fear not! Our README File Generator is here to save the day and make your documentation process as smooth as a freshly paved highway.

## üöÄ What Is This?

This tool is designed to automatically create professional, polished README files for your projects. With a sprinkle of magic and a dash of AI, it takes your project's details and transforms them into a comprehensive and engaging README file. 

## üåü Features

- **Instant Templates**: Choose from a variety of stylish templates that best fit your project's needs.
- **Customizable Sections**: Tailor each section to highlight your project's unique features.
- **Markdown Magic**: Automatically formats text, code snippets, and images to look sharp and clean.
- **Easy Integration**: Generate README files directly from your project repository or local directory.
- **Multilingual Support**: Create README files in multiple languages to reach a global audience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
Copypython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main script:
Copypython main.py

Enter project names when prompted. The script will generate README files in the output/ directory.
To add more details or customize the README content, edit the user_input/additional_details.yaml file.

This structure allows for easy expansion and maintenance of the project. You can add more features, such as additional templates or more complex user input handling, by modifying the existing files or adding new modules to the src/ directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Customize the generator to fit your needs by editing the configuration file:

- **`templates/`**: Directory where you can add or modify templates.
- **`config.json`**: Configure settings like default sections, style preferences, and more.
